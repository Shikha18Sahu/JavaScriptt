//  Default JavaScript :- Synchronous=> ek code execute hoga then another one 
//               Single threaded language

// ExecutionContext :- execute one line  of code at a time
//  console.log ->1
//  console.log ->2
 
//  in a asingle thread , each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing
//  call stack , memeory heap


 //Blocking Code vs Non Blocking Code
 block the flow of Program-> read file Synchronous
 Doesn't block execution -> read file async
